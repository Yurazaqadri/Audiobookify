AudioBookify: Bridging Text to Sound for the Visually Impaired
Abstract: This project addresses the pressing need for universal access to written content in the digital age. With over 253 million people worldwide experiencing vision impairment [11] (WHO – World Health Organization), the need for universal access to literature and educational materials is important. “AudioBookify” addresses this challenge by converting images and PDFs into audiobooks. First, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology transforms diverse forms of written material into text format. And then using Text to Speech (TTS) technology, it converts text into audio format. This project not only empowers visually impaired individuals but also caters to auditory learners and busy individuals.
